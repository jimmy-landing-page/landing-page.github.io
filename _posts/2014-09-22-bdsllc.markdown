fine carpentry, furniture, and other entertaining things.

Bug Dog Studios, LLC was a Brooklyn-based shop that specialized in custom cabinetry and small-space storage solutions, as well as project management and construction for fast-paced television home makeovers.  With my company, I managed projects and built amazing things for over 300 episodes of television on TLC, HGTV, DIY, Fine Living, Food Network, FYI, and more.
